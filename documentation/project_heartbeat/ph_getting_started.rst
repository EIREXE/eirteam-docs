Getting started
===============

Project Heartbeat is a cute community-driven rhythm game inspired by titles such as Clone Hero and Project Diva, featuring music
from top artists of the Eurobeat genre made popular by the Initial D anime and manga.
You can also create your own charts and share them with your friends! 

In August of 2023 the source code for the game was made public, while the game is not open source yet it will hopefully be a great resource.

You can check the sidebar to see what information is available in this documentation.
