Proposal: Challenges
====================

Many Project Heartbeat users have stated that playing in the community organized challenge events was fun, hence why I think it would be nice to implement this as an official feature.

The current idea was the following: Every certain amount of days the server would randomly pick a song, check if it complies with some minimal criteria for use in challenges and then start a new challenge.

Within this challenge users would be able able to compete, those who end up on the podium (1st/2nd/3rd) of the challenge would obtain a badge.

Unanswered questions
--------------------

Periodicity
^^^^^^^^^^^

- How often should challenges be started? Once a week? Once a day? I personally think once a week is a good balance.

Song requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What should be the requirements for a song to be allowed to be selected as a challenge? Examples would include:

- Maximum score of over Nk points on the highest difficulty.
- Having at least 3 different canonical difficulties (easy/normal/hard/extreme).
- Having a certain score ratio in workshop votes.

Actual running of the challenge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic idea of the challenge is that the highest score wins, the specifics could be:

- Any score obtained should also go on the normal leaderboard if it's a PB.
- What should count as winning the challenge? The podium for each difficulty? The podium for the highest? Should we have a special badge for whoever wins the challenge in the highest difficulty?
- Should users have to join the challenge manually or should any normal score also be counted for the leaderboard even if the user is unaware of it?
- After the challenge is over, should the winners be announced on the discord by a bot or something similar?
